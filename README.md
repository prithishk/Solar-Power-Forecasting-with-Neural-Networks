# Solar-Power-Forecasting-with-Neural-Networks
Solar energy forecasting plays a crucial role in optimizing renewable energy utilization, grid balancing, and smart energy management systems. This project uses **deep learning (Artificial Neural Networks â€“ ANN)** to predict **solar power generation** based on weather parameters like ambient temperature, module temperature, and solar irradiation.
